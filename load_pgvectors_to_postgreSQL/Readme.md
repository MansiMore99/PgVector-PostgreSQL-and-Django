# Vector Database with Postgres üóÉÔ∏èüöÄ

This project demonstrates how to set up a vector database using PostgreSQL, enhanced with movie embeddings generated by OpenAI. The dataset includes over 45,000 movies and 26 million ratings from more than 270,000 users.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

1. **PostgreSQL** - A powerful, open-source object-relational database system.
2. **Python 3.x** - The latest version of Python.
3. **Python Libraries**:
   - `openai` - For interacting with the OpenAI API.
   - `requests` - For making HTTP requests to download the dataset.
   - `psycopg2-binary` - For connecting to PostgreSQL from Python.

## Setup Guide

### 1. Set Up OpenAI API Key üîë

To use OpenAI's API, you need an API key. Follow these steps to set it up:

1. Obtain your OpenAI API key from the OpenAI website.
2. Set the API key as an environment variable or provide it when prompted in the script.

### 2. Download the Movies Dataset üì•

Download the necessary schema and data files for the movies dataset from Hugging Face.

1. **Schema File**: Contains the SQL commands to create the necessary tables.
2. **Data File**: Contains the movie data along with embeddings generated by OpenAI.

### 3. Install Required Packages üì¶

Install the necessary Python packages using pip:

- `wget`: For downloading files from the internet.
- `psycopg2-binary`: For PostgreSQL database interaction.
- `psycopg2`: PostgreSQL adapter for Python.

### 4. Connect to PostgreSQL and Load Data üóÑÔ∏è

1. Connect to your PostgreSQL database.
2. Create the schema by executing the SQL commands in the schema file.
3. Load the data into the database by executing the commands in the data file.

## Usage

Once the setup is complete, you can perform various operations on the vector database, such as:

1. **Querying Embeddings**: Use SQL queries to find the most similar movies based on embeddings.
2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the movie data and user ratings for insights.
3. **Custom Applications**: Build custom applications using the enriched movie dataset with vector embeddings.

## Conclusion

By following the steps outlined in this guide, you will set up a PostgreSQL database with vector embeddings for a comprehensive movie dataset. This setup enables efficient querying and analysis of movie-related data based on vector similarities. Enjoy exploring and building with this enriched dataset!
